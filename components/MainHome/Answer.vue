          This text introduces the concept of Work-Applied Learning (WAL), a
          model that focuses on learning through work-oriented projects and
          enables organizational learning, resulting in the creation and
          management of organizational knowledge and change. WAL is an extension
          of Work-Based Learning (WBL) and includes reflective thinking,
          critical analysis, and the utilization of collective activities where
          learning becomes everyoneâ€™s job. The text describes the phases of WAL,
          depicting the four distinct stages in the process of creating
          organizational change through WAL, which uses the fused action
          research (AR) method, action learning (AL) process, and reflective
          practice (ARAL) to achieve performance outcomes, including project
          outcomes, process outcomes, and learning outcomes. GCWAL Advisors and
          Facilitators guide leaders and managers through a consultative WAL
          process using the WAL formula.
